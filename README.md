First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2014

Genre: Fighting Game

Name: Monster Smackdown

Goal: To win the game, enemies must either all be depleted of health or knocked off the boundaries of the stage (not sure if I will implement one or both). Cheat keys will be made to either give infinite health or make attacks stronger.

Basic Mechanics: The character will be able to move left and right, jump, and crouch. Also, the character will have various attacks/air attacks dependending on which direction (or no direction: "neutral") is pressed along with the attack button

Level Differences: The first level will be fighting 100 underlings. Underlings will be fairly weak and able to be killed/knocked off stage in only a couple of hits. For the boss level, it will only be one character, but this character will be significantly stronger, will have higher health, and will have various special attacks that will take skill to evade.
