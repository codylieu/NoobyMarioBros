First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2014

THE PROJECT IS IN THE "gameproject" FOLDER.

Genre: Shooting Game

Name: Super Nooby Mario Bros.

Goal: To win the game, all minions must be cleared off the stage. Then the final boss has to be defeated. The final boss will need multiple hits (probably greater than 10) before he is defeated whereas all of the minions can be defeated in one hit. The player will need to dodge contact with enemies and projectiles to survive.

Basic Mechanics: In the first level, the character will be able to move up, down, left, and right while the character can only move up and down in the boss level. Also, the player will be able to fire a projectile that goes in a straight path. Enemies will move around randomly and may shoot projectiles.

Level Differences: To complete the first level, 20 of the Koopa (minions) must be defeated. Mario will be able to move up, down, left, and right to dodge the Koopa who are capable of bouncing off the four walls. Each Koopa needs to only be hit once to be removed, but if Mario is hit, he loses a life. For the boss level, Mario will only be able to move up and down. The boss will be Bowser who is also randomly moving up and down. The goal of this level is to defeat Bowser by hitting him with fireballs. It will take 10-20 fireballs to kill him. Bowser will either be protected by firing rockets or rockets firing randomly, similar to the first level except they will not be able to bounce off walls.
