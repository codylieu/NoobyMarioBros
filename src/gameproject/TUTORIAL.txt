This is the game I made, based off of the popular Mario franchise.

It is a shooter and has two levels, a minion level and a boss level.

For the minion level, you just have to kill all the koopa on the screen
and can move left, right, up, and down.

For the boss level, you have to kill Bowser, which takes 10 hits, while avoiding 
the endless barrage of Bullet Bills. in this level you can only move up and down.

The Z key is used to fire.


If you are having difficulty with the game, I have implemented some useful cheat codes:

Pressing 'X' will, not only make your fireball significantly bigger, but also allow it
to keep going after hitting an object, so it can hit multiple objects before going off screen.

Pressing 'C' will increase the amount of fireballs you can fire before having to wait and also allows
you to fire just by keeping your finger on the key.

Pressing 'V' was inspired by the Star Power Up in Mario. It, not only makes the player invincible, unable
to be killed, but it also allows the player to kill anything that it touches.
